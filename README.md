# Book-Notes-Project

## Overview
I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't remember all the most salient parts of the book. So I started taking notes. This capstone project is built on this idea. It is a website that has all the books that I have read, my notes, my ratings and when I read them. The books are sortable by rating and recency. 

## Main objectives
Integrate public APIs into web projects.

Gain more experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.

## Properties
1. Database Persistance
Persist data using a PostgreSQL database.

Use CRUD methods to manipulate data in the database.

2. Project Planning
Think through your project, researching the API documentation, project features, what data I will store, and how it will be used in my web application.

Think through the PostgreSQL command you will need to write to create the schema for your database.

3. Project Setup
This is a new Node.js project using Express.js.

Includes pg for working with your localhost PostgreSQL database.

Includes EJS for templating.

It has a frontend in HTML CSS JS.

4. API Integration
Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with your chosen API.

Used Axios to send HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

5. Data Presentation
Designed the application to present the book covers from the API and the data in my database in a user-friendly way.

Used appropriate HTML, CSS, and a templating engine like EJS.

Allowed the user to sort the data from the database.

6. Error Handling
Ensured that error handling is in place for both your application and any API requests. Gave users any user-relevant errors.


How to start your server: commands are needed to run my code: npm i  and then nodemon index.js, also make sure to use port 3000!
